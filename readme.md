# Database Design Project: AirBnB Relational Database
The goal of the project was to create a relational database that fit the requirements of AirBnB and some meaningful stored procedures and triggers. 

We gathered requirements and created an ER-diagram to model them. We also mapped functional dependencies and created a relational database schema after applying normalization rules. And we created the database along with stored procedures and triggers with PL/SQL.
